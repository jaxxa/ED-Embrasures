Adds embrasures for that can be shot through, while blocking passage, giving your colonists an advantage in combat.
Enemies will still be able to fire back but your troops will be in cover similar to sandbags and can’t be rushed by melee forces.

Setting have been added to allow you to customise the cost and protection given.
